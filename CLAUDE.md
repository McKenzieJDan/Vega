# Claude AI Interaction Guidelines

This document outlines best practices for interacting with Claude AI to maximize its effectiveness as a development assistant.

## Effective Prompting Strategies

### Be Specific and Clear
- Provide detailed context about what you're trying to accomplish
- Specify the desired format for Claude's response
- Include relevant constraints or requirements
- Use explicit instructions rather than open-ended questions

### Provide Context
- Share relevant code snippets, error messages, or documentation
- Explain the project background and goals
- Mention the technology stack and environment
- Reference previous conversations when building on earlier work

### Use Iterative Refinement
- Start with a general request, then refine with follow-up prompts
- Ask Claude to explain its reasoning when appropriate
- Request alternatives if the initial response isn't suitable
- Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps

## Task-Specific Guidelines

### Code Generation
- Specify the programming language and version
- Describe the desired functionality in detail
- Mention error handling requirements and edge cases
- Request comments and documentation within the code

### Debugging
- Share the complete error message
- Provide the relevant code context
- Explain what you've already tried
- Describe the expected vs. actual behavior

### Code Review
- Share the code to be reviewed with sufficient context
- Specify areas of concern or focus
- Ask for specific types of feedback (performance, security, style)
- Request concrete improvement suggestions

### Documentation
- Specify the target audience (developers, end-users, etc.)
- Mention the required level of detail
- Request specific documentation formats or styles
- Ask for examples and explanations where appropriate

## Response Format Preferences

### For Code Solutions
1. Brief explanation of the approach
2. Complete, runnable code solution
3. Explanation of key parts or decisions
4. Usage examples or test cases

### For Explanations
1. High-level overview
2. Detailed step-by-step explanation
3. Visual representations or analogies when helpful
4. References to additional resources

### For Troubleshooting
1. Identification of the likely root cause
2. Immediate solution or workaround
3. Long-term fix or prevention strategy
4. Explanation of why the issue occurred

## Handling Limitations

### Knowledge Cutoff
- Be aware of Claude's knowledge cutoff date
- Provide up-to-date information for recent technologies
- Verify critical information from authoritative sources

### Complex Problems
- Break down complex requests into smaller parts
- Use multiple conversations for extensive tasks
- Maintain context between related prompts
- Summarize progress periodically

### Ambiguity Resolution
- Clarify misunderstandings immediately
- Provide examples to illustrate unclear concepts
- Ask Claude to repeat back its understanding of complex requests
- Be explicit about assumptions

## Feedback and Improvement

### Provide Feedback
- Let Claude know which responses are helpful and why
- Clarify misunderstandings immediately
- Guide Claude toward your preferred style of interaction

### Refine Your Prompting
- Learn from successful interactions
- Document effective prompting patterns
- Share best practices with your team
- Continuously improve your prompting techniques

## Examples of Effective Prompts

### Code Generation Example
```
Please write a Python function that validates an email address using regex. The function should:
1. Accept a string input
2. Return True if the email is valid, False otherwise
3. Check for proper format (username@domain.tld)
4. Include comments explaining the regex pattern
5. Handle edge cases like empty strings

Please also include 3-4 test cases showing how the function works with different inputs.
```

### Debugging Example
```
I'm getting the following error when running my React component:
"TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined"

Here's my component code:
[code snippet]

I've already checked that the API call is working and returning data in the console. What might be causing this error and how can I fix it?
```

### Code Review Example
```
Please review this JavaScript authentication function for:
1. Security vulnerabilities
2. Error handling completeness
3. Performance issues
4. Code style and readability

[code snippet]

Specifically, I'm concerned about how I'm storing the user token and whether the error handling is sufficient.
