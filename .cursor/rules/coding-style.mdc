# Coding Style Guidelines

When writing or modifying code in this project, follow these style guidelines:

## General Principles
- Consistency is more important than personal preference
- Code should be readable and maintainable by the entire team
- Comments explain "why", code explains "how"
- Follow the principle of least surprise

## Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive, intention-revealing names
- Choose clarity over brevity
- Use consistent casing conventions:
  - `camelCase` for variables, functions, methods
  - `PascalCase` for classes, interfaces, types, enums
  - `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants
  - `kebab-case` for file names, URLs, and CSS classes
- Avoid abbreviations unless they are well-known

## Whitespace & Formatting
- Use 2-space indentation by default
- Limit line length to 80-100 characters
- Use blank lines to separate logical blocks of code
- Be consistent with brace placement
- Avoid trailing whitespace
- End files with a newline

## Comments & Documentation
- Write self-documenting code where possible
- Add comments for complex logic that isn't immediately obvious
- Document public APIs, interfaces, and functions
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes
- Use JSDoc/docstring style for function documentation
