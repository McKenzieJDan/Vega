## Overview

Vega provides a structured approach to maintaining consistent development practices across all your projects by leveraging Cursor's rules system. Instead of recreating guidelines for each new project, you can reference these standardized rules and customize them as needed.

### Rule Categories

* `.cursor/rules/coding-style.md` - General coding style guidelines
* `.cursor/rules/git-commits.md` - Conventional Commits format for git messages
* `.cursor/rules/code-review.md` - Guidelines for code review process
* `.cursor/rules/development-philosophy.md` - Core development principles
* `.cursor/rules/documentation.md` - Standards for project documentation

### Configuration

* `.cursor/settings.json` - Cursor IDE configuration settings
