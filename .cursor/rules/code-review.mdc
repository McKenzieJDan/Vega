# Code Review Guidelines

When participating in code reviews for this project, follow these guidelines:

## Reviewer Responsibilities

- Be respectful and constructive
- Focus on the code, not the person
- Provide specific, actionable feedback
- Explain the reasoning behind suggestions

## Author Responsibilities

- Explain complex changes or decisions
- Be open to feedback and suggestions
- Respond to all comments
- Make requested changes or explain why they shouldn't be made
- Thank reviewers for their time and input

## What to Look For

- **Maintainability**: Will the code be easy to change in the future?
- **Performance**: Are there any obvious performance issues?
- **Security**: Are there any security vulnerabilities?
- **Tests**: Is the code adequately tested?

## Review Process

1. Author creates a pull request with a clear description
2. Reviewers examine the code and provide feedback
3. Author addresses feedback or explains why changes aren't needed
4. Reviewers approve the changes when satisfied
5. Author merges the code after approval

## Best Practices

- Keep pull requests small and focused
- Review code in small batches
- Use automated tools to catch style and formatting issues
- Document decisions made during the review process
- Share knowledge and explain the reasoning behind suggestions
